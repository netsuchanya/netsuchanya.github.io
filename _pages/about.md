About Me
======
I am currently an undergraduate Geoscience student at Mahidol University, Kanchanaburi Campus, Thailand.
My academic interest focuses on rock physics, quantitative seismic interpretation, and CO₂ storage feasibility studies in intermontane basins of Thailand.
During my studies, I have worked on projects involving core description, lithofacies analysis, and fluid substitution modeling, emphasizing the application of geophysical methods to evaluate subsurface properties and carbon storage potential in the Suphanburi Basin. My technical experience includes data acquisition, Python-based rock physics analysis, and integration of seismic and well-log data for subsurface interpretation.

Beyond academics, I serve as the President of the Student Association at Mahidol University (Kanchanaburi Campus), where I cultivate leadership, teamwork, and communication skills through organizing academic and outreach programs such as Geologist the Next Gen and PTTEP Finding Next Explorer 2023.

In 2025, I participate in a Short-Term Academic Exchange Program at Peking University, and I have been selected for the OTC Asia 2026 Energy Education University Programme in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

My future goal is to apply geophysical techniques and quantitative interpretation to advance Thailand’s energy transition and CO₂ storage research toward sustainable development.
