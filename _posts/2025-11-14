## Fluid Substitution in Rock Physics  

Fluid substitution is a rock-physics tool that answers a simple question:  

> *If we change the pore fluid (for example, from brine to CO₂), how will the elastic properties of the rock change?*  

In practice, this means predicting how quantities such as:

- dry-rock bulk modulus \(K_{\text{dry}}\)  
- mineral (matrix) bulk modulus \(K_{\text{min}}\)  
- porosity \(\phi\)  
- saturated-rock bulk modulus \(K_{\text{sat}}\)  
- seismic velocities \(V_p\) and \(V_s\)  

respond when the fluid in the pore space is replaced.

This concept is essential for **CO₂ storage monitoring**, because injected CO₂ replaces formation water and slightly changes the seismic response. If we understand the rock–fluid system, we can turn small changes in amplitude or impedance into information about how much CO₂ is present and where it has moved.

## From Dry Rock to Saturated Rock  

A common way to perform fluid substitution is to use **Gassmann’s equation**.  
The idea is:

1. Start from a **dry-rock frame** with known \(K_{\text{dry}}\), shear modulus \(G_{\text{dry}}\), and porosity \(\phi\).  
2. Specify:
   - mineral bulk modulus \(K_{\text{min}}\)  
   - fluid bulk modulus \(K_f\) (brine, oil, CO₂, or a mixture)  
3. Compute the **saturated bulk modulus** \(K_{\text{sat}}\) using:

\[
K_{\text{sat}} = K_{\text{dry}} +
\frac{
  (1 - K_{\text{dry}}/K_{\text{min}})^2
}{
  \frac{\phi}{K_f}
  + \frac{1-\phi}{K_{\text{min}}}
  - \frac{K_{\text{dry}}}{K_{\text{min}}^2}
}
\]

4. Combine \(K_{\text{sat}}\), \(G_{\text{dry}}\), and the saturated density \(\rho_{\text{sat}}\) to obtain \(V_p\) and \(V_s\).

In my project, I focus on **P-wave–only** behaviour, which is realistic when only \(V_p\) or acoustic impedance is available from logs and seismic data.

## Crossplot: Kdry/Kmin vs. Porosity  

The crossplot below (after Abe et al., 2018) shows the relationship between the **normalized dry-rock stiffness** \(K_{\text{dry}} / K_{\text{min}}\) and **porosity**:

![Reference crossplot: Kdry/Kmin vs. Porosity](/images/crossplot1.png)

- The **x-axis** is porosity (fraction).  
- The **y-axis** is \(K_{\text{dry}} / K_{\text{min}}\).  
- Curves represent different rock-frame models or critical-porosity trends.  

We see an **inverse trend**:  
- As porosity increases, \(K_{\text{dry}} / K_{\text{min}}\) generally decreases.  
- Physically, more pore space means a more compliant (less stiff) rock frame compared to the mineral matrix.

This type of crossplot is useful for:
- Checking whether the rock frame behaves reasonably for the assumed lithology.  
- Comparing **measured** data points to **theoretical** trends from rock-physics models.

## Result from My Python Crossplot  

Using my own Python script (`10_subplot_03.py`), I generated a similar crossplot for one of my datasets (representative sandstone interval):

![Python result: Kdry/Kmin vs. Porosity](/images/crossplot2.png)

Key observations:

- The **data points** follow a downward trend:  
  higher porosity → lower \(K_{\text{dry}} / K_{\text{min}}\).  
- The **colour bar** shows bulk density (RHOB); denser samples usually cluster toward lower porosity and higher stiffness.  
- This behaviour is consistent with the reference model and gives confidence that the dry-rock estimates and input parameters are reasonable.

For CO₂ storage studies in the **Suphanburi Basin**, this type of QC step is important before performing any fluid substitution scenario, because it ensures that:

1. The dry-rock frame is realistic for the reservoir lithology.  
2. The model will respond in a physically meaningful way when we substitute brine with CO₂.

## Why This Matters for CO₂ Storage  

Putting it all together:

- **Fluid substitution** links changes in pore fluid (e.g., brine → CO₂) to changes in \(K_{\text{sat}}\), \(V_p\), and acoustic impedance.  
- **Crossplots** like \(K_{\text{dry}} / K_{\text{min}}\) vs. porosity help verify that our rock-physics model is consistent with real data.  
- Once the model is trusted, we can simulate different CO₂ saturation levels and predict how detectable they are in seismic data.

This provides a foundation for building **4D seismic monitoring strategies** for potential CO₂ storage sites in intermontane basins such as **Suphanburi**, even when only P-wave information is available.
